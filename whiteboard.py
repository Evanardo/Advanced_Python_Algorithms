# Consecutive Indices
# You are given a list of unique integers (arr), and two integers (a and b). \
#     Your task is to find out whether or not a and b appear consecutively in arr, and return a boolean value (True if a and b are consecutive, False otherwise).
# It is guaranteed that a and b are both present in arr.
# Example:
# Input: ([1, 6, 9, -3, 4, -78, 0], -3, 4)				
# Output: True
# Input: ([3,1,0,19], 19, 0)	
# Output: True

# def arr(a,b):
#     a= []
#     b= []
#     for i in a:
#         if a == b:
#             return True
#         else:
#             return False

# arr()

# def arr1(*numbers):
#     print(arr1)


# arr1(1,2,3,5,6,3,7,8)

# def arr2(*numbers):
#     print(arr2)


# arr2(1,2,3,5,6,4,7,8)

# def result(ans):
#     for i in arr1:
#         if arr1 == arr2:
#             return True
#         else:
#             return False
